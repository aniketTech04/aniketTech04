<h3><b>Hey there!</b> 👋</h3>

<p>I'm Aniket, learning software engineering by building real projects.</p>

<p>I focus on clean, pixel-perfect interfaces and doing things properly.</p>

<p>If an idea makes sense, I build it, refine it, and learn from it.</p>

<p>Currently working on small projects to strengthen my fundamentals.</p>

<h4>Fun facts:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>I care a lot about UI details</li>
  <li>I prefer building over tutorials</li>
  <li>I learn best by breaking and fixing things</li>
</ul>
